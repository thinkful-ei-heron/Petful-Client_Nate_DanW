##Summary

The Petful app uses a back-end linked list to create a virtual adoption center
where you can get in line for the adoption process, see the people waiting in
front of you and their adoption decisions, and make your own adoption decision
when you are at the front of the line. At the Petful adoption center you may only
adopt the pet that has currently been at the adoption center for the longest amount
of time.
